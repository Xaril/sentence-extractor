# sentence-extractor
Sentence extractor consists of scripts helping when **singular sentences** must be extracted from pdf files, i.e. when a course that doesn't matter (swedish: _flumkurs_) requires you to bring one sentence from every text that you should have read for a seminar.

Sentence extractor makes use of **textract**, which requires [this](http://textract.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to work. An installation script will be created in the future.

TODO:
* Write installation script.
